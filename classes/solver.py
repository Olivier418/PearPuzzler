    solution-buffer cap and a node budget, returns FULL/BUDGET/DONE, and
    is re-entered with its stack intact. An EMA of nodes/s sizes ~2 ms
    chunks, which is how `time_limit` stays exact to ~2 ms and how the

        `time_limit` (seconds, counted from the first `next()`) and
        `max_solutions` both default to infinity; the search stops as soon
        as either is reached. The time is checked at kernel chunk
        boundaries, so it can overshoot by about one chunk (~2 ms).

        `seed` randomises the order solutions are found in without
        changing the set: it draws one random priority per placement,
        used only to break ties the search's own ordering leaves open.
        Unseeded, ties fall to placement index order. Nothing is ever
        reordered or shared, so a seed can't disturb anything indexed by
        placement.

        Every node branches on one *item* and tries every placement that
        settles it, so the branches partition the node's solutions:
        nothing is missed and nothing is found twice. `branch` picks which
        kind of item, and only affects speed:

        - "both" (the default): whichever of the two below has fewer live
          placements at this node. The counts are directly comparable --
          a child of either kind places exactly one block -- so this is
          simply better informed than either alone, and it wins or ties
          everywhere.
        - "cell": always the empty cell with the fewest live placements.
        - "block": always the unplaced block with the fewest. Sound, and
          a useful baseline, but much the weakest: it cannot notice a
          cell that nothing can cover until some block runs out of room,
          so it prunes almost nothing where little is pre-filled. On a
          book puzzle that costs a factor (worst measured:
          main_puzzles/65, 2 s against 0.01 s); on the empty main board
          it finds no solution at all in 30 s, against ~1 ms for "both".

        Measurements for the three modes are in SOLVER_NOTES.md.

        `order` ranks each node's candidate placements. It changes the
        order solutions come out in, never the set. The same rule is
        applied to whatever candidate list the node built, and every rule
        keys off a placement rather than off the item that was branched
        on, so ordering is uniform across all three `branch` modes by
        construction. Left as None it is on exactly when a limit is set,
        which is when it can pay: it finds the first solutions markedly
        sooner, but a full enumeration visits the same nodes whatever
        order siblings are tried in, so there it is pure overhead.
        Accepts:

        - True / "counts": each candidate's cells' live-placement counts,
          sorted ascending and compared like a tuple, so a placement
          covering the scarcest cells goes first.
        - "pockets": fewest empty cells stranded with no empty neighbour.
          Those cells can never be covered, so this rejects a dead branch
          one ply early.
        - "fanout": fewest options left for the next empty cell.
        - False: table order (but see the seed note above).
