"""Search for puzzles that are strictly more difficult than a given
`start` puzzle: fewer solutions and/or more empty spaces, never worse on
either.

Since Setup._validate_area guarantees the blocks' total area equals the board's,
nr_empty_spaces of a candidate depends only on *which* blocks are
pre-placed, never on *which placement* is used -- so the search is really
just the 2**n_blocks subsets of blocks (same space regardless of how many
placements each block has), pruned first by that free empty-spaces count
(a subset with fewer empty spaces than `start` can never beat it, so it's
skipped before any solving happens).

For each surviving subset, this is thorough rather than sampled: every way
to place that subset's blocks without overlapping each other is tried (see
_enumerate_placement_combos), each realized as a candidate and solved for
its true nr_solutions, keeping the best (lowest) found. Three things keep
that tractable:
  - subsets are visited in decreasing nr_empty_spaces order, so every
    frontier member found so far already has at least as many empty
    spaces as whatever's being searched next -- which means its
    nr_solutions alone is a valid ceiling, tighter than `start`'s once
    anything better than `start` has actually been found (see
    most_difficult_puzzles);
  - each realization's solve is capped at that ceiling (tightening further
    to the best found so far within the same subset -- see
    _best_realization), so a losing realization is abandoned the moment
    that's established rather than counted out exhaustively;
  - overlap conflicts reject most placement combinations before they ever
    reach the solver (_enumerate_placement_combos).

A candidate only survives into the result if it actually beats `start`
(at least as good on both axes, strictly better on one); what's returned
is only the mutually non-dominated subset of those survivors -- the
Pareto frontier, as a (PuzzleBook, SolutionBook, SolveStatsBook) triple --
each tagged with `difficulty` (an argument to most_difficult_puzzles, default
constants.FRONTIER_DIFFICULTY) for plotting.plot_puzzlebook, and named A, B,
C, ... in order of decreasing nr_empty_spaces.

    Subsets are visited in *decreasing* nr_empty_spaces order (largest
    first -- free to compute, see module docstring), which is what lets
    the search tighten itself as it goes: by the time a given subset is
    reached, every frontier member found so far already has at least as
    many empty spaces as it does (they were found earlier in this same
    descending order), so the tightest of their nr_solutions -- not
    `start`'s -- is the real ceiling worth searching for here. This is
    also why nothing below `start_empty` needs visiting at all once
    reached: sorted descending, everything after it is `< start_empty`
    too. In practice this means the search keeps shrinking itself: once
    some subset achieves an unbeatable nr_solutions (1), every
    smaller-empty subset from then on inherits that same tight ceiling
    instead of `start`'s original, looser one.

    The ceiling passed to a given subset's search is the most solutions a
    candidate with that many empty spaces could have and still survive (see
    _ceiling): every frontier member with strictly more empty spaces
    demands strictly fewer solutions, one with equally many allows a tie.
    Once that reaches 0 -- e.g. a frontier member with a single solution
    and more empty spaces -- nothing is left to find and the subset is
    skipped without any placement enumeration or solving, which is what
    makes the late, low-empty-space subsets nearly free. The realization
    found is still tested against the real (running) frontier with
    _dominates itself, so the ceiling only has to never exclude a genuine
    survivor, not to be exact.

    Returns (puzzles, solutions, stats): a PuzzleBook and the matching
    SolutionBook and SolveStatsBook (from solving.solve_puzzlebook, so the
    timings are the same kind as any other solve's) holding only the
    mutually non-dominated frontier -- not every candidate that merely beat
    `start`. The puzzles are named A, B, C, ... from most to fewest empty
    spaces. Each has `difficulty` set to `difficulty` (default
    constants.FRONTIER_DIFFICULTY -- deliberately not one of
    constants.DIFFICULTY_COLORS' own tiers, since it isn't part of the game;
    plotting.plot_puzzlebook colors it via constants.FRONTIER_COLOR instead)
    and a real Solution with every one of its solved grids (nr_solutions is
    `len(solution.grids)`, or `len(stats.elapsed)` as plotting.plot_puzzlebook
    reads it, rather than an attribute tacked onto the Puzzle). The triple
    has the same shape as serialization.load_run's, so it plots the same
    way: `plot_puzzlebook(puzzles, stats)`.
